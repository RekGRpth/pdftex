These directories were distributed as part of the pdfTeX documentation
in TeX Live for many years, but have been unnecessary for almost as
long.  The information in pdftex-pdfkeys is in the main manual,
and the thanh/ext example files have been superseded by pervasive
support in distributed packages.
