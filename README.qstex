This is a branch of pdfTeX 1.50 (i.e. trunk) in use at QuinScape. 

Its main improvements against 1.50 are
- proven code for merging optional content of included pdfs
- proven code for Large File Support (at least on Linux i386 and amd64)
- assorted bugfixes
- partly improved documentation

The code is relased AS IS; use at your own risk.
