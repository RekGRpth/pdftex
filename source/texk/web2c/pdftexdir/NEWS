------------------------------------------------
pdfTeX 3.141592-1.11a was released on 2003-08-02
------------------------------------------------

Major changes since 1.10b
-------------------------
- New command \pdftrailer analogue to \pdfcatalog whose argument ends up in the
  trailer dictionary.

- The behaviour when an included pdf has a newer version than the one specified
  with \pdfoptionpdfminorversion can be controlled by the new internal integer
  \pdfoptionpdfinclusionerrorlevel: If it's 0, pdfTeX gives only a warning; if
  it's 1, it raises an error. 
    This can also be set in pdftex.cfg with pdf_inclusion_errorlevel

- The syntax for outlines has been extended to allow attributes:
  <outline spec> --> <attr spec> <action spec> [count <number>] <general text>
  See http://www.ntg.nl/pipermail/ntg-pdftex/2003-June/000165.html

- The syntax of \pdfobj has been extended:
  \pdfobj <object type spec>                              (h, v, m)
  <object type spec> --> reserveobjnum
                       | [useobjnum <number>] [<attr spec>] [stream [<attr spec>]] <object contents>
  <object contents> --> <file spec>
                      | <general text>
  When the optional keyword `reserveobjnum' and `useobjnum' is not given, the
  behaviour is unchanged. 
  See also http://tug.org/mailman/htdig/pdftex/2003-March/003814.html

- Bugfix: /CreationDate didn't care for the timezone and could be fooled.
  See http://www.ntg.nl/pipermail/ntg-pdftex/2003-July/000223.html

- Bugfix: The translation of 8-bit characters in included pdfs that had their
  eighth bit set sometimes got wrong because of a missing typecast.
  See http://www.ntg.nl/pipermail/ntg-pdftex/2003-July/000216.html
  
- Bugfix: pdfTeX -ini would crash with a minimal file because it didn't read
  it's config and so didn't know anything about fonts.
  See http://tug.org/pipermail/pdftex/2003-July/004262.html
  
- Bugfix: \pdfstartlink would produce spurious /NewWindow entries. Also the
  syntax of <action spec> and <goto-action spec> has been cleaned up.
  See http://www.ntg.nl/pipermail/ntg-pdftex/2003-June/000167.html 

- Bugfix: \pdffontattr was not used for T3 fonts.
  See http://tug.org/pipermail/pdftex/2003-June/004127.html

- Bugfix: The cropbox of an included pdf would sometimes not be used.
  See http://tug.org/pipermail/pdftex/2003-May/004037.html

- pdfTeX uses xpdf 2.02

------------------------------------------------
pdfTeX 3.141592-1.10b was released on 2003-02-26
------------------------------------------------

Major changes since 1.10a
-------------------------
- The numbers in transformation matrices are allways written with maximum
  precision (see http://tug.org/pipermail/pdftex/2003-February/003596.html).

- Incorporated the new version of TeX: 3.141592

- Bugfix: Numbers in pdfs would sometimes be just a wee bit of (changed
  implementation of pdftoepdf.convertNumToPDF).

- Bugfix: When setting the /Producer, /Creator or /CreationDate keys with
  /pdfinfo pdfTeX would also insert default values which caused duplicate keys
  in the info dict (see
  http://tug.org/pipermail/pdftex/2003-February/003524.html).

- The reading of mapfiles is much faster (see
  http://tug.org/pipermail/pdftex/2002-July/002843.html).
  
- Bugfix: AR5 had problems with the CTM when displaying in "fit visible" mode
  (see http://tug.org/pipermail/pdftex/2002-May/002688.html).

- Bugfix: str_in_str had wrong indices (see
  http://tug.org/pipermail/pdftex/2002-March/002367.html).

- Bugfix: decimal_digits defaulted to 0, which caused problems with included
  images when including pdfs (see
  http://tug.org/pipermail/pdftex/2003-February/003518.html). 
  It now defaults to 4.
  
- Bugfix: the type of included images was decided based only on the extensions;
  now pdfTeX looks for magic bytes at the start of files (see
  http://tug.org/pipermail/pdftex/2003-February/003519.html)

-----------------------------------------------
pdfTeX 3.14159-1.10a was released on 2003-01-16
-----------------------------------------------

Major changes since 1.0
-----------------------
- pdfTeX is now able to produce pdf1.4 (which is also the default) and has
  almost complete support for including pdf1.4 files:
  - Additional attributes like MetaData are copied from included pdfs.
  - Currently the Page Group attribute (see sections 7.3.6 and 7.5.5 of the pdf
    1.4 reference) of included pdfs is NOT copied (as we don't know how to
    handle this when imposing pdfs). 
      This means including pdfs with transparency features will work as long as
    the included pdf doesn't use Page Groups; if it does, the result might not
    be what is expected (One application known to use Page Groups is Adobe
    Illustrator v9++). The distributed pdfTeX binaries will give a warning
    about any occurance of a Page Group in an included pdf and ignore the Page
    Group (thus producing syntactically correct pdfs but probably not the
    intended output).  
      Acrobat 5++ and newer versions of Jaws display files without Page Groups
    correctly, so this might not really be a problem.  
      See pdftoepdf.cc for preprocessor flags which allow this behaviour to be
    changed (copying the Page Group (most likely producing incorrect pdf) or
    treating Page Groups as errors).
    
- The new primitive \pdfoptionpdfminorversion sets the pdf version of the
  generated file and the latest allowed pdf version of included pdfs:
        \pdfoptionpdfminorversion=3
  tells pdfTeX to set the pdf version to 1.3 and allows only included pdfs with
  versions <= 1.3 . 
    The default for \pdfoptionpdfminorversion is 4 for pdf 1.4
    This must appear before any data is written to the generated pdf file, so
  you should it put at the very start of your files.
    This can also be set in pdftex.cfg with pdf_minorversion

- It is now possible to specify the pdf page box to use when including pdfs.
  The syntax has been extended:
    \pdfximage [<image attr spec>] <general text>           (h, v, m)
    <image attr spec> --> [<rule spec>] [<attr spec>] [<page spec>] [<pdf box spec>]
    <pdf box spec> --> mediabox|cropbox|bleedbox|trimbox|artbox
  The default is cropbox (which defaults to mediabox), to be compatible with
  previous versions of pdfTeX.
    The page box specified at \pdfximage can be globally overridden with the
  config parameter always_use_pdfpagebox and the command
  \pdfoptionalwaysusepdfpagebox <integer>, where 0 is the default (use whatever
  is specified with \pdfximage), 1 is media, 2 is crop, 3 is bleed, 4 is trim
  and 5 is artbox. This can only be set once per object, i.e. the value used at
  \pdfximage is remembered.
    See the pdf reference for an explanation of the boxes.
  
- The support for the inclusion of jpeg images has been extended to allow the
  inclusion of JPEG/Exif files which are produced by digital photo cameras
  (thanks to Hartmut Henkel).

- The support for the inclusion of tif images has been removed as it was of
  limited use (it worked only for gray-scale and rgb images) and produced wrong
  results (all other images types where treated as rgb images). 
  Tif images can be converted on *nix on-the-fly to pngs with the help of
  ImageMagick, epstopdf.sty or pdftex.def v0.4 or newer, and this rule:
    \DeclareGraphicsRule{.tif}{png}{.png}{`convert #1 `basename #1 .tif`.png}

- The extensions for pdf encryption have been removed, since they make the
  pdfTeX code overly complex. Those needing pdf encryption are encouraged to
  produce a standalone program for encrypting pdfs.

- pdfTeX now writes a usage statistic about the pdftex specific memory to the
  log.

- numerous bugfixes, most of them in the inclusion of pdfs.

- pdfTeX uses xpdf 2.01

- pdfTeX uses libpng 1.2.5
