The pdfTeX team is happy to announce the release of a new stable version:

===========================================================================
                               pdfTeX 1.40.4
===========================================================================

This is the announcement of pdfTeX 1.40.4, an extended version of TeX that
can create PDF directly from TeX source files and enhance the result of TeX
typesetting with the help of PDF.

===========================================================================
  Main changes of pdfTeX 1.40.4
===========================================================================

- Bugfixes: 
  - It was impossible to set the font Flags to 4 in map entries (762)
  - The font Flags of non-embedded fonts were wrong (794)
    Now pdfTeX uses the Flags from map entries (if found) or guesses values
    for the base14 fonts. It also warns when you not-embedd a font without
    Flags
  - Subsetted fonts still had their private UniqueID copied (774)
  - \pdfunescapehex returned a wrong result if the last character was not a
    hexadecimal digit and the last hex pair was incomplete (777)
  - Copying a box with \pdfstartlink inside produced the same /Link
    annotation object multiply, with same object number and identical
    coordinates on the page (799)
  - When trying to use a font without TFM, without map entry, and no PK
    font available, a broken PDF was produced. Now no PDF is generated and
    the error messages have been improved (721)
  - \pdfprimitive was broken (see
    http://www.ntg.nl/pipermail/ntg-pdftex/2007-April/002860.html)
  - The -recorder option of web2c didn't record fonts, included images and
    some other files (772)
  - Using \pdfximage in IniTeX before \dump caused a crash when the format
    was used (824)
- Improvements: 
  - pdf compression is now a bit faster (patch 726)
  - the behaviour of TeX when it asks for a file name has been improved
    (756)
- pdfTeX uses libpng 1.2.18
- pdfTeX uses xpdf 3.02
