INSTALL for pdfTeX 1.11a
========================

This distribution is a stripped-down version of the TeXlive distribution.
The code of pdfTeX is in texk/web2c/pdftexdir 

Try the script Build in this directory. If it succeeds, you should end up
with the files pdftex, pdfetex, pdftex.pool and pdfetex.pool in texk/web2c

Replace the so-named files in your TeX installation with these and
regenerate all pdf*-formats of your TeX installation.

If all else fails, follow the clues in README, texk/INSTALL and
texk/web2c/INSTALL.
