The pdfTeX team is happy to announce the release of a new stable version:

===========================================================================
                               pdfTeX 1.40.6
===========================================================================

This is the announcement of pdfTeX 1.40.6, an extended version of TeX that
can create PDF directly from TeX source files and enhance the result of TeX
typesetting with the help of PDF.

===========================================================================
  Main changes of pdfTeX 1.40.6
===========================================================================

- Bugfixes:
  - inclusion of encrypted PDFs was broken (861)
  - PDFs > 2GiB (LFS) would be broken, even on 64-bit systems. Now the
    basic support for LFS is there, you only need to supply the right
    compiler flags (this is not yet done automatically). See build.sh for
    hints on compiling.
  - Page groups in pdfs (see 1.10a below) are now handled correctly (741)
  - When including transparent PNGs pdftex now automatically adds a Page
    Group (896)
  - broken map files would lead to core dumps
  - unusual TrueType fonts would lead to an assertion error (874)
  - the null object in object table was never initialized
  - included PDFs with /PieceInfo lost their /LastModified date
  - an empty colorstack crashed pdftex (897)
- pdfTeX uses libpng 1.2.24
- pdfTeX uses xpdf 3.02pl2
